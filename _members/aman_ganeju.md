I'm Aman, and I am a wedding and portrait photographer, based in Bhaktapur, Nepal.

I relish the moments by capturing them into the photographs. More importantly, my defining quality is to capture people, their emotions, and gestures in a frame. Analogously, I have a deep interest in manifesting cultures and lifestyles by portraying a pictorial story. I stumble upon people, places, corners, and every place where I find the ripples of these creative stories. Every grave face, every wrinkle, every smile is a story and I bear that in mind.
My intuitions have led to finding beauty everywhere. Almost everything exhilarates me. Almost every place is a story to me. It all goes down to a simple statement, "beauty lies altogether in the eye of the beholder".As a professional photographer, my instinct is to capture the beauty in places where people least expect to find it.
