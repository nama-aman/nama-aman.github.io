I am interested in distributed systems and cloud technology
from a Programming Languages and Software Engineering perspective.
Currently, I mainly focus on advancing Infrastructure as Code (IaC),
aiming at robust deployments in modern DevOps organizations.
For more information, please consult my [private webpage](https://dsoko.de){: target="_blank" }.

I recently moved to the University of St. Gallen.
Before I was part of the [Software Factory 4.0 project](https://www.software-factory-4-0.de/){: target="_blank" } at the Technical University of Darmstadt.
